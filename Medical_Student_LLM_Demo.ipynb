You will be asked to answer questions about if you have used AI large language models in practice, which AI large language models you have used, how you have used AI large language models, and information about your medical school. All survey responses are captured anonymously.\\n\\nTIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation will take approximately 15 minutes.\\n\\nRISKS AND BENEFITS: The risks associated with this study are no foreseeable risks associated with completing this survey. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from completing this survey. However, by completing this survey, you will be contributing to our understanding of how medical students are using large language models in medical school and clinical settings. Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your academic performance.\\n\\nPAYMENTS: You will not receive any payment for completing this survey.\\n\\nPARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS: If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The alternative is not to participate. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific journals. Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study. All survey responses will be recorded anonymously.\\n\\nCONTACT INFORMATION:\\nQuestions? Please contact Dr. Jenna Lester at 415-353-7800.
